Like any other Programming Language, We use in JavaScript some Escape Sequences to skip any specific symbol ( "" , '' , \ , / ...), to use them as a Normal string.


\n - Newline

\\ - Backslash

\' - Single quote

\" - Double quote

\b - Backspace

\r - Carriage return

\f - Form feed

\v - Vertical tab (rarely used)
